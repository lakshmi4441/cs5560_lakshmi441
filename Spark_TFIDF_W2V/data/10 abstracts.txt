Abstract 
INTRODUCTION:  
Adenoid cystic carcinoma of the breast (breast-ACC) is a rare tumor with a favorable prognosis, despite its triple-negative status and special type of basal-like tumor for which scant population-based descriptive data exist. We sought to provide new population-based information on breast-ACC in India. Due to the paucity of the number of cases, the natural history of the disease is not fully understood. This study was undertaken to examine the clinico-pathological characteristics of the disease and to evaluate the outcome of surgical intervention in a tertiary referral care centre. 
MATERIALS AND METHODS:  
A retrospective analysis of all patients diagnosed and treated for ACC Breast in our hospital over the past 10 years was carried out (2005-2015). A database of the characteristics of these patients was developed. In all, 14 patients were identified. The investigations performed included routine blood investigations, chest X-ray, bone scan and either an ultrasound or a CT scan. 
RESULTS:  
During the time period of 10 years, of 2347 with breast malignancy admitted to our department, only 14 were diagnosed as having ACC (3.15%). All patients were women (100%). The patients had a median age of 60.7 years (range 37-81). The most common symptom was lump in the breast. Two patients (14.2%) presented with nipple and skin retraction and two patients (14.2%) were asymptomatic with the diagnosis made by an incidental finding on routine examination. The CT and/or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed the typical features of carcinoma breast. All the 14 patients were taken up for surgery. Nine patients underwent Modified radical mastectomy and five patients underwent Breast conservation surgery. Axillary lymph node dissection was carried out in seven patients and sentinel lymph node biopsy in the remaining. Tumor cells had a characteristic histologic pattern of ACC of the breast. Perineural invasion was present in six cases. 
DISCUSSION:  
ACC of the breast is a very rare malignancy, accounting for less than 0.1% of all breast neoplasms. It affects the left and right breasts equally and tumors arise irrespective of the breast quadrants. However, in about 50 percent of patients, lesions are found in subareolar region. Pain or tenderness described in the minority of cases has not been correlated with histologically-confirmed perineural invasion. ACC is categorized as a basal-like subtype of breast carcinoma. Most cases are macroscopically well-circumscribed. Occasionally, pink, tan, or gray microcysts are evident. A tumor typically consists of a dual-cell population of luminal and myoepithelial-basal cells which may be arranged in one or more of three architectural patterns: tubular-trabecular, cribriform, and solid-basaloid. There is no consensus on the optimal management for patients with ACC of the breast. Based on its indolent clinical course and favorable outcome, ACC of the breast is generally cured by breast-conserving surgery, such as wide excision or quadrantectomy with or without radiotherapy. 
CONCLUSION:  
Breast-ACC among women is characterized by ER-negative/PR-negative expression, rare regional lymph node involvement, a favorable prognosis with excellent survival, and absence of associated cancers. These findings reinforce the importance of tailored treatments for breast-ACC and the apparent heterogeneity of basal-like breast cancers.

Abstract 
Breast cancer stem cells (BCSCs), a small subset of breast cancer cells with stem cell-like properties, are essential in tumor formation, metastasis, resistance to anticancer therapies, and cancer recurrence. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are involved in tumorigenicity by regulating specific oncogenes and tumor-suppressor genes, and their roles in BCSCs are becoming apparent. A novel, 3-dimensional (3D), semisolid culture system was established to culture MCF-7 spheroid cells with high percentage of BCSCs. The differences in miRNA expression among the MCF-7 parental cells, BCSC-enriched MCF-7 spheroid cells, and CD44+/CD24- MCF-7 cells were evaluated by miRNA microarray, and the high expression of miR-210 in MCF-7 spheroid cells and CD44+/CD24- MCF-7 cells was verified by quantitative RT-PCR. MCF-7 cells were cultured in a hypoxic chamber to detect the effect of hypoxia on miR-210 expression and the stemness of the cells. The 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2- yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide (MTT), transwell, and sphere-formation assays were performed to detect the proliferation, migration, and self-renewal ability of miR-210-overexpressed MCF-7 cells and MCF-7 spheroid cells with miR-210 knocked down. The target of miR-210 was validated with a dual-luciferase reporter assay and Western blotting. In vivo xenograft assay and metastasis assay were performed to study the effects of miR-210 targeting E-cadherin on BCSCs growth and lung metastasis, and the tumors were assessed by immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence. We developed a novel 3D, semisolid culture system to culture MCF-7 spheroid cells, which are enriched in BCSCs, and found, by performing miRNAs expression profiling, miR-210 was up-regulated in those cells compared with MCF-7 parental cells. High miR-210 expression was also detected in CD44+/CD24- MCF-7 cells and human CD44+/CD24- breast cancer cells, which was demonstrated to be partially due to the hypoxic microenvironment around BCSCs in MCF-7 spheroids or solid tumors. Ectopic expression of miR-210 in MCF-7 cells promoted their migration, invasion, proliferation, and self-renewal in both in vitro and in vivo studies. We further reported that miR-210 suppressed E-cadherin expression by targeting the open reading frame region of E-cadherin mRNA and by up-regulation of E-cadherin transcription repressor, Snail. Accordingly, E-cadherin overexpression compromises the migration, invasion, proliferation, and self-renewal ability of miR-210-overexpressed MCF-7 both in vitro and in vivo. These findings reveal a novel regulatory pathway centered on hypoxia-mediated miR-210 targeting of E-cadherin, which contributes to the properties and breast tumorigenesis of BCSCs.-Tang, T., Yang, Z., Zhu, Q., Wu, Y., Sun, K., Alahdal, M., Zhang, Y., Xing, Y., Shen, Y., Xia, T., Xi, T., Pan, Y., Jin, L.

Abstract 
OBJECTIVE:  
Women diagnosed with breast cancer younger than 45 years (young breast cancer survivors-YBCS) and their biological relatives face significant stressors. Although family support is an important coping resource, little is known about YBCS' and relatives' support and whether it is interdependent. The study described family support in YBCS and their biological relatives; identified demographic, clinical, and psychosocial predictors of support; and determined the interdependence of support in YBCS-relatives family units. 
METHODS:  
Data were collected from a random sample of YBCS and their first- or second-degree female relatives. Actor-partner interdependence models (APIM) explored predictors and interdependence of YBCS' and relatives' family support in dyads (YBCS and relative) and triads (YBCS and two relatives). 
RESULTS:  
Among n = 310 YBCS and n = 431 first- or second-degree relatives, family support was higher in triads compared to dyads. APIMs identified actor effects in dyads, and actor and partner effects in triads. Across all family units, YBCS' higher self-efficacy was associated with higher YBCS support (actor effect) and relative support (partner effect); YBCS' prior diagnosis of depression was associated with lower YBCS and relative support (actor and partner effect); cost-related lack of access to care was associated with lower support among YBCS (actor effect) and relatives (actor and partner effect). 
CONCLUSIONS:  
Family support was interdependent and was affected by self-efficacy, depression, and access to care. Interventions should include YBCS and relatives, enhance self-efficacy and access to care.

Abstract 
BACKGROUND:  
Patients with sentinel lymph node (SLN) metastases may not require axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) but it remains unclear if patients with a positive ultrasound-guided axillary core biopsy (ACB) would satisfy such criteria. 
AIMS:  
The aim of this study was to assess if breast cancer patients with a positive pre-operative ACB have more aggressive tumour characteristics/higher axillary nodal burden compared to those with a positive SLN. 
METHODS:  
Data was extracted from a prospectively maintained breast cancer database between 2012 and 2015. Patients who underwent ALND after either positive ACB or SLN were included and tumour characteristics/nodal burden were compared. 
RESULTS:  
One hundred eighty patients underwent ALND, 125/180 after positive ACB and 55/180 after positive SLNB. Patients with positive ACB were more likely to undergo mastectomy (chi-square test; p = 0.03) and have higher tumour grades (Mann-Whitney test; p < 0.01) compared to the SLNB group. Median positive nodes excised during ALND were 2 (1-22) and 1 (1-11) for ACB and SLNB groups respectively (p < 0.001). Fifty-six patients received neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NCT). Of 72/125 patients in the ACB group not receiving NCT, the median number of positive nodes was 4 (range, 1-22). Ten patients within the ACB group satisfied ACOSOG Z011 criteria. 
CONCLUSION:  
Breast cancer patients with a positive ACB are more likely to have aggressive tumour characteristics and higher nodal burden compared to those identified as having axillary nodal disease on SLNB, which may affect surgical decision making.

Abstract 
We present the case of a postmenopausal patient with a secondary metastatic ER-positive, HER2-negative breast cancer who was successfully treated with fulvestrant and alpelisib following six lines of therapy. The tumour showed two uncommon PIK3CA mutations, and with the combination of alpelisib and fulvestrant the patient went from ECOG grade 3, before the start of this therapy, to ECOG grade 1 during treatment until progressive disease after 6 months. This unexpected benefit emphasizes the importance of performing a Next Generation Sequencing (NGS)-based assay to screen for several cancer genes in the metastatic setting, even after more than four lines of therapy and a high ECOG grade. Moreover, the use of alpelisib may be beneficial for uncommon PIK3CA mutations.

Abstract 
BACKGROUND:  
The purpose of this study was to clarify the clinicopathologic characteristics of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients with smoking-related chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and to evaluate the biological behavior of this disease. We investigated the association between smoking-related COPD, the recurrence-free proportion (RFP) and the clinicopathological features of clinical stage I NSCLC patients. 
METHODS:  
Between 2005 and 2014, 218 consecutive patients with clinical stage I NSCLC underwent complete resection with lobectomy or greater and systematic lymph node dissection. Differences in categorical outcomes were evaluated by the χ2 test. RFPs were estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method, and differences were evaluated using the log-rank test. 
RESULTS:  
The 5-year RFP of clinical stage I NSCLC patients with smoking-related COPD was 55%, which was significantly lower than in those without smoking-related COPD (85%; p < 0.001). Postoperative pathological factors, including moderate or poor histological differentiation, intratumoral vascular invasion and lymph node metastasis, were detected more often in patients with smoking-related COPD. In adenocarcinoma patients, the 5-year RFP of patients with smoking-related COPD was 47%, which was significantly lower than in those without smoking-related COPD (87%; p < 0.001). The presence of a solid component was more frequently found in patients with smoking-related COPD (p = 0.007). 
CONCLUSION:  
Clinical stage I NSCLC patients with smoking-related COPD have histologically more invasive tumors than those without smoking-related COPD.

Abstract 
PURPOSE:  
The vitamin D receptor (VDR) endocrine system has emerged as an endogenous pleiotropic biological cell regulator with anti-neoplastic effects on breast, colorectal, and prostatic adenocarcinomas. We studied the association of gene expression, polymorphisms of VDR, CYP27B1, and CYP24A1 genes and serum vitamin D levels as surrogate markers of disease progression in patients with acid reflux, Barrett's esophagus (BE), or esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC). 
METHODS:  
We analyzed blood and tissue samples from patients with biopsy-confirmed BE or EAC for vitamin D levels, gene expressions, and polymorphisms in VDR (FokI [F/f], BsmI [B/b], ApaI [A/a], and TaqI [T/t]), CYP27B1 (HinfI [H/h]), and CYP24A1 (Hpy1881 [Y/y]). Percentages of homozygous dominant/recessive or heterozygous traits were assessed for each polymorphism in all patient subgroups. 
RESULTS:  
Genomic Bb and FF polymorphisms were highly prevalent in EAC patients, whereas BE patients had a high prevalence of wild-type Hpy1881 (YY polymorphism). Some polymorphisms (Yy for CYP24A1, bb for VDR) were noted only in EAC patients. Yy and bb forms were both uniquely present in some EAC patients without associated Barrett's lesions, but not in patients with concomitant BE. AA and bb polymorphisms were associated with decreased response to neoadjuvant therapy. A high level of VDR and CYP24A1 mRNA expression was observed in EAC tissue of non-responders. Serum vitamin D deficiency was common in EAC patients. 
CONCLUSIONS:  
Specific polymorphisms in vitamin D metabolism-related genes are associated with the likelihood of reflux-BE-EAC progression. Identifying such polymorphisms may aid in development of better surveillance and diagnostic and therapeutic protocols.

	8	Surgical options for male breast cancer. 
Fentiman IS1. 
Author information 
Abstract 
BACKGROUND:  
Male breast cancer (MBC) is a rare disease for which no randomised controlled trials (RCT) have been conducted to determine optimal surgical management. The available data have been reviewed to identify reasonable options and reveal areas in need of investigation. 
METHODS:  
All published series on the surgical management of MBC have been reviewed to determine approaches to treatment of the primary, the breast and the axilla together with the psychological sequelae of surgery. 
FINDINGS:  
Mastectomy is still the major surgical offer but a convincing case can be made for the use of neoadjuvant endocrine treatment in order to facilitate breast conserving surgery. Sentinel node biopsy has been successfully used for staging MBC although nomograms for prediction of nodal status are inadequately calibrated. There are psychological sequelae of mastectomy in males and as yet no evidence that the needs of those with MBC are being met. 
CONCLUSIONS:  
Collaborative studies are required so that men can participate in meaningful RCTs to provide an evidence-based rational foundation for the surgery of MBC.

Abstract 
Elastin is a long-lived extracellular matrix protein responsible for the structural integrity and function of tissues. Breast cancer elastosis is a complex phenomenon resulting in both the deposition of elastotic masses and the local production of elastin fragments. In invasive human breast cancers, an increase in elastosis is correlated with severity of the disease and age of the patient. Elastin-derived peptides (EDPs) are a hallmark of aging and are matrikines - matrix fragments having the ability to regulate cell physiology. They are known to promote processes linked to tumor progression, but their effects on breast cancer cells remain unexplored. Our data show that EDPs enhance the invasiveness of MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells through the engagement of matrix metalloproteases 14 and 2. We therefore suggest that elastosis and/or an aged stroma could promote breast cancer cell invasiveness.

Abstract 
Skin metastases from colorectal carcinoma are rare and signal advanced disease. Skin metastasis refers to growth of cancer cells in the skin originating from an internal cancer. In most cases, cutaneous metastasis develops after the initial diagnosis of the primary internal malignancy and late in the course of the disease. In very rare cases, skin metastasis may occur at the same time or before the primary cancer has been discovered and may be the prompt for further thorough investigation. The incidence of skin metastasis varies but is somewhere between 3-10% in patients with a primary malignant tumor. Most common ones are melanoma (45%), breast cancer (30%), nasal sinus cancers (20%), cancer of the larynx and cancer of the oral cavity (12%) cases. Here we present a case of 39-year-old man presented to us with multiple subcutaneous lesions over the chest and forehead. Fine needle aspiration cytology of skin nodules revealed metastatic adenocarcinoma features. Further imaging of the abdomen with computed tomography (CT) revealed circumferential narrowing of caecum and ascending colon. The patient was managed with palliative right hemicolectomy in view of constipation and palliative chemotherapy as systemic treatment. An extensive review of the English literature did not reveal extensive data on metastatic subcutaneous nodules leading to diagnosis of colon cancer.
